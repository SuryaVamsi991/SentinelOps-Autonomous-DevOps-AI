## 🔧 2. Environment Setup

### 📡 Backend Configuration

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd sentinelops-backend
   ```
2. Create your `.env` file from the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Open `.env` and fill in your keys:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Get one from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)

   ```

## 🚀 3. Running the Project

### Phase A: Start the Engine (Docker)

In your terminal (from the root or backend folder):

```bash
cd sentinelops-backend
docker compose up -d
```

_Wait ~1 minute for Postgres and Redis to initialize._

### Phase B: Power Up the AI

Run these one-time commands to prep the system:

```bash
# 1. Train the ML Risk Model
docker compose exec api python -m app.ml.train

# 2. Seed the Demo Data (The magic part)
docker compose exec api env PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/seed_demo_data.py
```

### Phase C: Launch the Dashboard

Open a **new terminal tab**:

```bash
cd sentinelops-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
